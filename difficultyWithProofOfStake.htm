    <h1>Proof of Stake Algorithm</h1>
    <p>In this document, I will be outlining the issues that I had with trying to implement my very own Proof of Stake (POS) algorithm.</p>

    <pre>Note: all of this code is wrote in <strong>Go</strong>.</pre>

    <h3>Problem One</h3>
    <p>The first problem that I encountered was the following:

        I was trying to use a block struct that I have created for my Proof of Work (POW) Algorithm. Below is how my Block looks like:
    </p>

    <pre><code>
        type Block struct {
            Index int
            Timestamp string 
            PrevHash interface{}
            Transactions Transaction
            <strong><u>ProofOfWork</u></strong> bool 
            BlockHash string 
        }

        type Transaction struct {
            Sender string
            Receiver string
            Amount float32
        }
    </code></pre>

    <p>The above code is the Syntax for making a block for a POW Blockchain. The problem then arrised when I was coming back to my POS algorithm, because I was trying to
        have the above syntax for a POS block - this is entirely wrong!
    </p>

    <p>Below is the code that I previously wrote for the start of my POS algorithm / code:</p>

    <pre><code>
    type Block struct {
        Index int
        Timestamp string 
        PrevHash interface{}
        Transactions Transaction
        ProofOfWork bool 
        BlockHash string 
    }

    type Validator struct {
        block Block
    }

    func (v *Validator) ValidateBlock(block *Block) bool {
    }
    </code></pre>

    <p>After doing some analysis on my code, I realized one crucial problem. A validator has a Block type 
        as a field. <strong>But:</strong> a Block has a <strong>"ProofOfWork"</strong> field, I am implementing a 
        <strong>Proof of Stake algorithm</strong>. So I had to abandon this code - simply because it is completly useless!
    </p>

    <h3>Problem Two</h3>
    <p>The next problem initially did not seem like an issue, but after doing some analysis 
        and getting some feedback from ChatGPT, there are many issues. See below for more information
        about the issue:
    </p>

    <pre>Note: <strong><u>n</u></strong> is denoted for how many times I do something. For example, n = 5, then the we iterate n times.</pre>

    <ul>
        <li>I have a function called: CreateNPosBlocks. This function is responsible for making n POS Blocks. I was doing this,
            But, I was also trying to get a validator's address, trying to generate and randomize funds (from a wallet package) and whatever the funds were 
            do something with those funds. 
        </li>

        <li>As you can see this is already problematic, because I'm doing all of this in the one function! This work needs to be 
            seperated into there own distinct functions.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <pre>This is where I am currently in my project for my POS algorithm.</pre>
    
    <p>I have figured out how I'm going to get my POS algorithm to work, see  
        here for the details, on how I fixed the issue: <a href="figuredOutThePOSAlgoProblem.htm">Fixed the Problem</a>.</p>
