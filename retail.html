    <h1>Welcome on this page of my portfolio you are going to see what I did in my first retail job</h1>
    <!-- have done in the retail industry</h1> -->

    <p>During one of my summer holidays I decided to construct a cv to hand in to retail jobs to try and get a small job for 
        summer. <br><br> I handed in my cv to a handful of companies and a few weeks later I got a a job request from Movies @ Gorey, this 
        is my local cinema. <br><br> During my time working for Movies @ Gorey I picked up very good communication and people skills, and in 
        some cases patience. I worked for about 3 and a half years in Movies @ Gorey, so I have some experience in the retail work.
        
        <br><br> For most cinema's there is something called a cinema day. <br>
        What does this mean? <br>
        Cineam day is a day where the cinema reduces all of there prices for everything that they sell.
        Because of this, many people decide to go to the cinema on that day <stromg>only</stromg>, this 
        results in a lot of mess and work to be completed.
        
        <br><br> I am mentioning all of this information because during these times, is when you have to be:
        <ul>
            <li>Very calm</li>
            <li>Collected</li>
            <li>Prepared for anything</li>
            <li>Communicate effectively as a team</li>
        </ul>

        These skills are also incredibily important for the development of software, so if you are able to be calm, collected etc in a retail
        environment, you should be able to do so in a professional space, such as building software products. <br><br> Particularly if you
        are using an agile approach for developing your software these core skills are used daily.
