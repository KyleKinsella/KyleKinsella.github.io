                <li>To summarize my Convolutional Neural Network project, I used a dataset from kaggle <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sshikamaru/fruit-recognition/data">Fruit Classification Dataset</a>.</li><br> 
            
                <li>I did pre processing in this project, I changed the size of the images in my dataset from 100 x 100 to be 25 x 25 and much more.</li><br>

                <li>I watched the following YouTube videos for this machine learning project:

            <h2>Data Sources</h2>
           
           <p>Before I started to work on my convolutional neural network project, I found a dataset that I wanted to use for my 
            convolutional neural network project. For my convolutional neural network project I wanted to create a machine learning 
            model to be able to learn different types of fruit images. And to try and train a convolutional neural network to be able
            to identify the different types of fruits.
            
            This is the dataset that I used for this project
            <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sshikamaru/fruit-recognition/data">Fruit Classification Dataset</a>.</p>

            <h2>Pre Processing</h2>
            <p>During my convolutional neural network project, I did pre-process my dataset. I changed the size 
                of each image from 100 x 100 to be 25 x 25. I also used <strong>batch_size=32</strong>, this means that the images are in batches(groups),
                this makes it easier to process while in the training of the model. I also split my data into training and validation sets. I also 
                am using <strong>seed=123</strong>, this means that each time the code runs the split is different each time.

            <h2>Data Understanding & Visualization</h2>
            <p>During my convolutional neural network project, I did not have to much issues with visualization, the main reason for this 
                is due to a convolutional neural network does a lot of calculations behind the scenes so there is not to much to visualize. This means that we 
                don't need to do to much graphs for this model. But I do have a confusion matrix to see how accurate my model is.
                
                Below is a confusion matrix figure for my convolutional neural network model. I also have an image 
                of a fruit. I wrote a function to let the user enter what fruit they want to see, and depending 
                on what fruit they picked they can pick a certain image to see.<br><br>

            <h2>Algorithms Online & Sources</h2>
            <p>During the development of my convolutional neural network project I found a few online sources that were very helpful for this project.</p>

            <strong>YouTube:</strong> <a href="https://youtu.be/Gz4VzbSI4OM?si=s4k2L5WUu3-PA9c5">1. YouTube</a><br>
            <strong>ChatGpt:</strong> <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">ChatGPT</a><br>
            <strong>YouTube:</strong> <a href="https://youtu.be/JIBsJx7U0Xw?si=2IdH96kSli0DlvzG">2. YouTube</a><br>
            <strong>YouTube:</strong> <a href="https://youtu.be/aBIGJeHRZLQ?si=0Z-z_jYJdmdn9Dqw">3. YouTube</a><br>
            <strong>YouTube:</strong> <a href="https://youtu.be/0w-D6YaNxk8?si=Va2cKtzsV7vNG0gd">4. YouTube</a><br>


            <p>The above websites were <strong>very helpful</strong> for this project. I used YouTube[1] to watch a video to fix a
                problem with a tensorflow import in python. I watched another YouTube video[2] to change a windows setting to be able to install
            tensorflow. I watched another YouTube video[3] to make a basic neural network with python. And finally I watched another YouTube
        video[4] to see how to install tensorflow on windows.</p><br>

            <h2>Tools & Technology Used</h2>
            <p>When I was developing my Convolutional Neural Network model I used the following technologies:</p>
          
            <strong>Python</strong> <br>
            <strong>Jupyter Notebooks</strong>  <br>
            <strong>Tensorflow</strong> <br>
            <strong>Keras</strong> <br>
            <strong>Matplotlib</strong> <br>
            <strong>Numpy</strong> <br>
            <strong>Pandas</strong> <br>
            <strong>Matplotlib.image Mpimg</strong> <br>
            <strong>Pathlib Path</strong> <br>
            <strong>Os</strong> <br>
            <strong>PIL Image</strong> <br>
            <strong>Tensorflow.keras Layers</strong> <br>
            <strong>Sklearn.metrics Confusion_matrix</strong> <br>
            <strong>Seaborn Sns</strong> <br><br>

            <p>During this project I got familiar with some of the python libraries such as Tensorflow, 
            Keras, Tensorflow.keras Layers and much more.<br><br>

            Another technology that I had never used before in python is called Tensorflow. This is a library for making any 
            type of machine learning model and training your chosen model.<br><br>

        	Before I had started to code anything for this project, I already had a good understanding on how the python programming language and how it operates and
        	I also had a good idea on how to use Jupyter Notebooks. These technologies are a must when working with data science and machine learning.
