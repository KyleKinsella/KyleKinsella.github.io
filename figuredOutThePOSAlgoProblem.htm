    <h1>My Proof of Stake (POS) Algorithm: How Does it Work?</h1>

    <!-- <p>Instead of me doing what I was doing previously for <strong>problem Two</strong>, I 
        decided to do the following:
    </p> -->

    <h3>Retrieving a Validator</h3>
    <p>This is the first and <strong>most important</strong> aspect of this algorithm. We need 
        to select a validator to validate a block. Below is my way of how I'm going to make my proof of stake 
        algorithm work, for selecting a validator.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><i>Step 1:</i></strong> Manually create a text file and within this file, have a handful of <strong>Validator</strong> addresses and 
            the amount of <strong>Stake</strong> for each Validator.
        </li>

        <!-- <li>
            <strong><i>Step 2:</i></strong> Create a map data structure, mapping an address to an int. 
            The address will be of type <strong>string</strong> and the Stake will be of type <strong>int</strong>.
        </li> -->

        <li>
            <strong><i>Step 3:</i></strong> Use one of my functions that I made earlier in the project, to read the file, that 
                contains the validators and stake amounts.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong><i>Step 4:</i></strong> Chose a random validator weighted by stake (more stake = higher probability of being chosen)
            
            <!-- <strong><i>Step 4:</i></strong> Get a random value out of the file that was read from the last 
            step.  -->
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong><i>Step 5:</i></strong> Whatever validator is selected, they must validate whatever block they are given 
                or they receive. 
        </li>
    </ul>
