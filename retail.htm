        <h1>My First Retail Job: Working at Movies@ Gorey</h1>

        <p>During one of my summer holidays I decided to construct a cv to hand in to retail jobs to try and get a small job for 
            summer. <br><br> I handed in my cv to a handful of companies and a few weeks later I got a a job request from Movies @ Gorey, this 
            is my local cinema. <br><br> During my time working for Movies @ Gorey I picked up very good communication and people skills, and in 
            some cases patience. I worked for about 3 and a half years in Movies @ Gorey, so I have some experience in the retail work.
            
            <br><br> 
            
            For most cinemas there is something called a cinema day. <br>
            What does this mean? <br>
            Cinema day is a day where the cinema reduces all of there prices for everything that they sell.
            Because of this, many people decide to go to the cinema on that day <stromg>only</stromg>, this 
            results in a lot of mess and work to be completed.
            
            <br><br> 
            
            I am mentioning all of this information because during these times, is when you have to be:
            <ul>
                <li>Very calm</li>
                <li>Collected</li>
                <li>Prepared for anything</li>
                <li>Communicate effectively as a team</li>
            </ul>

            These skills are also incredibily important for the development of software, so if you are able to be calm, collected etc in a retail
            environment, you should be able to do so in a professional space, such as building software products. <br><br> Particularly if you
            are using an agile approach for developing your software these core skills are used daily.

        <h1>My First Retail Job: Working at Movies@ Gorey</h1>

        <p>
            During one of my summer holidays, I decided to construct a CV and hand it in to local businesses
            in hopes of landing a summer job. A few weeks later, I was offered a position at
            <strong>Movies@ Gorey</strong>, my local cinema.
        </p>

        <p>
            Over the course of about 3.5 years working there, I gained valuable experience in retail,
            particularly in communication, teamwork, and patience.
        </p>

        <p>
            One of the busiest times was on <strong>Cinema Day</strong>. A day when all prices are reduced,
            attracting large crowds and creating a fast-paced, high-pressure environment.
        </p>

        <p>Working on days like this required me to be:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Very calm</li>
            <li>Collected</li>
            <li>Prepared for anything</li>
            <li>An effective communicator and team player</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
           These soft skills are especially important because staying calm and communicating clearly 
           under pressure translate directly to software development environments, particularly in agile teams 
           where coordination and adaptability are essential.
