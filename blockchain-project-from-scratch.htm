         <h2>The Goal</h2>
            <p>The goal of this project is to gain a deeper understanding on how a blockchain works under the hood.</p>

            <h2>Technologies</h2>
            <p>I have chose to build my user-interface with <strong>React</strong>, I chose React because it's a widely used framework in modern software development and I want to strenghten my skills with it by applying it to a real world Personal Project.</p>

            <p>I have developed some of the core features that a blockchain has, such as: <strong>Blocks, Proof of Work (POW) and Proof of Stake algorithms, Transactions, Public & Private Key-Pairs and Addresses.</strong></p>
            <p>I am currently working on the <strong>user-interface</strong> to enchance the user experience for end users. Once the UI is more polished I will be developing my own <strong>Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)</strong>.
            My DAO will be taking most of the core inspiration from <strong>Nouns DAO:</strong> <a href="https://nouns.wtf/"><button>nouns.wtf</button></a></p>
