            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>To summarize my k nearest neighbor project, I used a dataset from kaggle: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prathamtripathi/drug-classification">Dataset</a>.</li><br> 
            
                <li>I did do pre processing in this project, I pre-processed the BP and Cholesterol columns in my dataset 
                    from strings to integers. This had to be done in order to train my k nearest neighbor model.</li><br>
            
                <li>I do understand the data that I have, I am able to identify what columns I need to train my knn model. 
                    I don't have any images of my model, due to many issues when trying to do so.</li><br>

                <li>I used <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">ChatGPT</a>, <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/k-nearest-neighbours/">GeeksForGeeks</a>,
                    <a href="  https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/k-nearest-neighbor-classification-scikit-learn">DataCamp</a> and 
                    <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-visualize-knn-in-python/">GeeksForGeeks</a>.
                for help to try and get my model to visualize.</li><br>
            
                <li>During this project I used Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Matplotlib, Pandas, Sklearn.model_selection, 
                    Sklearn.neighbors, Sklearn.metrics, Seaborn, Mlxtend.plotting and Numpy.</li>

            <h2>Data Sources</h2>
           <p>Before I started to work on my k nearest neighbour project. For my k nearest neighbour project I wanted to create a machine learning model 
            to classify what type of drug someone would need to use. For this project I used this dataset on kaggle
            <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prathamtripathi/drug-classification">Drug Classification Dataset</a>.</p>

            <h2>Pre Processing</h2>
            <p>During this project on k nearest neighbour I did do pre-processing. In this phase of my project I had the following
                heading's in my dataset (see below). I pre-processed the BP column to be the following: <strong>LOW = 0, NORMAL = 1 and HIGH = 2</strong>. 
                I did the same for Cholesterol, but there was only two headings for Cholesterol: <strong>NORMAL = 0 and HIGH = 1</strong>. 
                I used BP, Cholesterol and Na_to_K for my features for my k nearest neighbour model to predict what drug someone should get.<br>

                <li>Cholesterol</li>
                <li>Na_to_K (Na to Potassium Ration)</li>

            <h2>Data Understanding & Visualization</h2>
            <p>During my k nearest neighbour project I had one <strong>major problem</strong>. The problem was I was not able to 
            visualize my k nearest neighbour model on a graph. <strong>I spent hours and hours trying my best</strong> to try and get it to 
            work but I was not able to get my model on a graph. I did ask chatgpt for some help but he was not to helpful for this 
            task. Below are two python libraries that I tried to use (I also tried many others but I got roughly the 
            same result) and the code that I wrote but could not get it to work.
                
            <ul>
                <li>from mlxtend.plotting import plot_decision_regions</li>
                <li>from sklearn.decomposition import PCA</li>
            </ul>

            My code that I wrote <br>
            <strong>from mlxtend.plotting import plot_decision_regions <br>
            import numpy as np <br>

            X = np.array(X) <br>
            y = np.array(y) <br>

            # y = y.astype(np.int_) <br>

            dataset['Drug'] = dataset['Drug'].map({'drugC':0, 'drugB':1, 'drugX':2, 'drugY':3, 'drugA':4}) <br>

            newY = np.array(dataset['Drug'], dtype=int) <br>

            plot_decision_regions(X, newY, clf=knn, legend=2) <br>

            # plt.xlabel('X')  <br>
            # plt.ylabel('Y') <br>
            # plt.title('KNN with K=5')</strong> <br><br>
         
            Due to me not being able to visualize my k nearest neighbour model on a graph I do not have 
            any figures to show unfortunately.

            <h2>Algorithms Online & Sources</h2>
            <p>During the development of my k nearest neighbour project I found a few online sources that were some help to me.</p>

            <strong>ChatGpt:</strong> <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">ChatGPT</a><br>
            <strong>GeeksForGeeks:</strong> <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/k-nearest-neighbours/">GeeksForGeeks</a><br>
            <strong>DataCamp:</strong> <a href="  https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/k-nearest-neighbor-classification-scikit-learn">DataCamp</a><br>
            <strong>GeeksForGeeks:</strong> <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-visualize-knn-in-python/">GeeksForGeeks</a><br>

            <p>The above websites were a <strong>little</strong> helpful for this project. I used chatgpt, to try and figure out 
            a way to visualize my k nearest neighbour model but I was not able to get it to work. I used geeksforgeeks for 
            some additional research on k nearest neighbour. I used datacamp to try and visualize my k nearest neighbour model. 
            And I found another geeksforgeeks link, this link showed my how to visualize a k nearest model in python but it was with random
            data points. I tried to do it with my dataset but it did not work.</p><br>

            <h2>Tool's & Technology Used</h2>
            <p>When I was developing my k nearest neighbour model I used the following technologies:</p>
          
            <strong>Python</strong> <br>
            <strong>Jupyter Notebook's</strong>  <br>
            <strong>Matplotlib</strong> <br>
            <strong>Pandas</strong> <br>
            <strong>sklearn.model_selection train_test_split</strong> <br>
            <strong>sklearn.neighbors KNeighborsClassifier</strong> <br>
            <strong>sklearn.metrics confusion_matrix</strong> <br>
            <strong>seaborn sns</strong> <br>
            <strong>mlxtend.plotting plot_decision_regions</strong> <br>
            <strong>numpy np</strong> <br><br>

            <p>During this project I got familiar with some of the python libraries such as KNeighborsClassifier, Pandas,
            seaborn and much more.<br><br>

            Another technology that I had never used before in python is called KNeighborsClassifier. This is a library 
            for making a k nearest neighbor model and training your k nearest neighbor model.<br><br>

        	Before I had started to code anything for this project, I already had a good understanding on how the python programming language and how it operates and
        	I also had a good idea on how to use Jupyter Notebooks. These technologies are a must when working with data science and machine learning.
