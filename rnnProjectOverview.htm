            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>To summarize my Recurrent Neural Network project, I used a dataset from Tensorflow <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/datasets/mnist/load_data">Tensorflow Dataset</a>.</li><br> 
            
                <li>I did pre processing in this project, I split the dataset into training and test sets and I also normalized the X_train 
                    and X_test.</li><br>
            
                <li>I used <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSpXCRTOLJA">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">ChatGPT</a>.
                These resources where very handy during this machine learning project.</li><br>
            
                <li>During this project I used Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Tensorflow, Numpy, Matplotlib, Random and much more.</li>

            <h2>Data Sources</h2>
           
           <p>Before I started to work on my recurrent neural network project, I found a dataset that I wanted to use for my 
            recurrent neural network project. The dataset that I used for this project is not from kaggle, it is a dataset that is in the tensorflow
            library. The dataset is called: <strong>tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data</strong>, the dataset has images of numbers in 
            training and test sets.
            
            For my recurrent neural network project I wanted to create a machine learning model to be able to 
            learn different types of number images. And to try and train a recurrent neural network to be able
            to identify the different types of numbers. This is the dataset that I used for this project:
            <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/datasets/mnist/load_data">Tensorflow Dataset</a>.</p>

            <h2>Pre Processing</h2>
            <p>During my recurrent neural network project, I did pre-process my dataset. After I imported the mnist
                dataset, I split the dataset into training and test sets. I also then normalized <strong>X_train and X_test</strong>.<br>

            <h2>Data Understanding & Visualization</h2>
            <p>During my recurrent neural network project, I did not have to much issues with visualization, the main reason for this 
                is due to a recurrent neural network does a lot of calculations behind the scenes so there is not to much to visualize. This means that we 
                don't need to do to much graphs for the recurrent neural network machine learning model.
                
                I also have an image of a number. I wrote a function to let the user enter an index for a number that they want to see, then my model 
                will predict a number for whatever number is in the index that the user has entered. Then my model will show this to the user.<br><br>

            <h2>Algorithms Online & Sources</h2>
            <p>During the development of my recurrent neural network project I found a few online sources that were very helpful for this project.</p>

            <strong>YouTube:</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSpXCRTOLJA">YouTube</a><br>
            <strong>ChatGpt:</strong> <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">ChatGPT</a><br>

            <p>The above websites were <strong>very helpful</strong> for this project. I used YouTube to watch a video 
                to code out a recurrent neural network and I used chatgpt for some help when I was coding out my recurrent neural network model.</p><br>

            <h2>Tool's & Technology Used</h2>
            <p>When I was developing my recurrent neural network model I used the following technologies:</p>
          
            <strong>Python</strong> <br>
            <strong>Jupyter Notebook's</strong>  <br>
            <strong>Tensorflow</strong> <br>
            <strong>Keras</strong> <br>
            <strong>Tensorflow.keras.layers Dense, Dropout, LSTM</strong> <br>
            <strong>Matplotlib</strong> <br>
            <strong>Numpy</strong> <br>
            <strong>Tensorflow.keras.preprocessing image</strong> <br>
            <strong>Random</strong> <br><br>
            
            <p>During this project I got familiar with some of the python libraries such as Tensorflow, 
                Keras, Tensorflow.keras Layers and much more.<br><br>
    
                Another technology that I had never used before in python is called Tensorflow. This is a library for making any 
                type of machine learning model and training your chosen model.<br><br>
    
                Before I had started to code anything for this project, I already had a good understanding on how the python programming language and how it operates and
                I also had a good idea on how to use Jupyter Notebooks. These technologies are a must when working with data science and machine learning.
