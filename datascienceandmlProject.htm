                        <h3>Naïve Bayes</h3>
                        <p>During this project, I explored Naïve Bayes. Naïve Bayes is a supervised learning machine learning model.
                            Naïve Bayes is a generative learning algorithm, this means the model looks for the inputs of a given class 
                            or category (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=naive+bayes">Naïve Bayes</a>).
                            
                            There are three types of Naïve Bayes (See below).

                        <ul>
                            <li>Gaussian - works on continuous data</li>
                            <li>Multinomial - works on discrete data</li>
                            <li>Bernoulli - works on binary/boolean data</li>

                        <h3>Support Vector Machines</h3>
                        <p>During this project, I explored Support Vector Machines. Support Vector Machines fall under both supervised learning and discriminative classification. 
                            Support Vector Machines work very good in N-dimensional space. <br></p>

                        <h3>K Nearest Neighbour</h3>
                        <p>During this project, I explored K Nearest Neighbour. K Nearest Neighbour is a 
                        supervised learning classifier (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=knn">K Nearest Neighbour</a>). 
                        K Nearest Neighbour works by grouping data points that are
                        close in area, this is done mathematical using the Euclidean distance formula.

                        <p>During this project, I explored K Means Clustering. K Means Clustering is an un-supervised learning algorithm, it is used for 
                            clustering groups of data together. In K Means Clustering there is something called a centroid. A centroid is a random plot
                            in the middle of a cluster, the area where the centroid was will change after each iteration of the 
                            K Means Clustering model. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/k-means-clustering">K Means Clustering</a><br></p>
