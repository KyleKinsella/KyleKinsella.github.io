                <li>To summarize my support vector machine project, I used a dataset in the sklearn.datasets python library.</li><br> 
            
                <li>I did not do any pre processing in this project, I used a dataset that was already made and pre-processed in the sklearn.datasets python library.</li><br>
            
                <li>I do understand the data that I have, I am able to identify what columns I need to train my support
                vector machine model. I also have two images of my support vector machine throughout the development of this project.</li><br>

                <li>I used <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">ChatGPT</a> 
                for help when trying to discriminating between my two classes.</li><br>
            
                <li>During this project I used Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Matplotlib, Sklearn.datasets,

            <h2>Data Sources</h2>
           <p>Before I started to work on my support vector machine project, I did some study on what support vector machines are before doing
           any coding. For my support vector machine project I wanted to create a machine learning model to classify a certain type of  
           flower using support vector machines. I used a dataset in the <strong>sklearn.datasets</strong> library in python. This is the dataset that I 
           used for my project for support vector machines.</p>

            <h2>Pre Processing</h2>
            <p>During this project on support vector machines I did not do any pre-processing, I used a dataset from sklearn.datasets, this dataset had some data about 
            flowers, such as: <br> 
            <ul>
                <li>sepal length (cm)</li>
                <li>sepal width (cm)</li>
                <li>petal length (cm)</li>
                <li>petal width (cm)</li>

            <h2>Data Understanding & Visualization</h2>
            <p>During this project for support vector machines I had one big issue, the issue was I was not able to draw a 
            decision boundary to discriminate between my two classes. After many hours of debugging I finally got my 
            decision boundary to discriminate between my two classes. Below are two figures that illustrate 
            what problem I encountered: <br><br>
            
            <strong>Figure 1:</strong> support vector machine with a line but nowhere near my two classes.<br>
            <strong>Figure 2:</strong> support vector machine with my line discriminating the two classes.<br>
            <br><br>

            <h2>Algorithms Online & Sources</h2>
            <p>During the development of my support vector machine project I found an online source that was some help to me.</p>

            <strong>ChatGpt:</strong> <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">ChatGPT</a><br>

            <p>The above website was a <strong>little</strong> helpful for this project. I used chatgpt, to try and find out 
            why was my decision boundary line not discriminating between the two classes. I asked him something like:
            how do I draw a line that separates my two classes.</p><br>

            <p>The reason why my support vector machine model was not discriminating between my two classes was because I was not using 
            a Logistic Regression model. So I implemented a Logistic Regression model to my code and eventually I got it to work.</p>

            <h2>Tool's & Technology Used</h2>
            <p>When I was developing my support vector machine model I used the following technologies:</p>
          
            <strong>Python</strong> <br>
            <strong>Jupyter Notebook's</strong>  <br>
            <strong>Matplotlib</strong> <br>
            <strong>Sklearn.datasets load_iris</strong> <br>
            <strong>Sklearn.linear_model LogisticRegression</strong> <br>
            <strong>Pandas</strong> <br>
            <strong>Sklearn.model_selection train_test_split</strong> <br>
            <strong>Sklearn.svm SVC</strong> <br>
            <strong>Sklearn.metrics confusion_matrix</strong> <br>
            <strong>Numpy np</strong> <br><br>
           
            <p>During this project I got familiar with some of the python libraries such as Sklearn.linear_model, Pandas,
            Sklearn datasets and much more.<br><br>

            Another technology that I had never used before in python is called Sklearn.svm. This is a library for making a support
            vector machine model and training your support vector machine model.<br><br>

        	Before I had started to code anything for this project, I already had a good understanding on how the python programming language and how it operates and
        	I also had a good idea on how to use Jupyter Notebooks. These technologies are a must when working with data science and machine learning.
